.TH "UNICC" 1 "Oct 2019" "Version 1.7"

.SH NAME
.P
\fBunicc\fR \- universal parser generator.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
unicc [OPTION]... FILE
.SH ABOUT
.P
UniCC is a LALR(1) parser generator.
.P
It compiles an augmented grammar definition into a program source code that parses the described grammar. Because UniCC is intended to be target\-language independent, it can be configured via template definition files to emit parsers in almost any programming language.
.P
UniCC comes with out of the box support for the programming languages \fBC\fR, \fBC++\fR, \fBPython\fR (both 2.x and 3.x) and \fBJavaScript\fR. Parsers can also be generated into \fBJSON\fR and \fBXML\fR.

.SH COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
.P
The UniCC command\-line interface supports various, combinable options to
invoke, modify and specialize the parser generation process, or to trigger
further tasks.
.SS -a, --all-warnings
.P
Runs UniCC to print all warnings that come up with the grammar. UniCC
normally suppresses some warning messages that raise up during the parse
table constructions according to their importance.
.SS -b NAME, --basename NAME
.P
Defines the specified basename \fINAME\fR to be used for the output
file(s) instead of the one derived by the #prefix\-directive or by the
name of the input filename. This basename is used for all output files
if the provided parser template causes the construction of multiple
files.
.SS -G, --grammar
.P
Dumps an overview of the finally constructed grammar to stderr, right
before the parse\-tables are generated.
.SS -h, --help
.P
Prints a short overview about the command\-line options and exists.
.SS -l TARGET, --language TARGET
.P
Sets the target language via command\-line. A "#!language" directive in the
grammar definition will override this value.
.SS -n, --no-opt
.P
Disables state optimization; By default, the resulting LALR(1) parse
states are optimized during table construction by introducing a special
SHIFT_REDUCE action which combines a shift and reduction. This method is
possible when the last symbol of a production is shifted. Standard
LALR(1) parsers only support SHIFT or REDUCE, not both operations at the
same time. When this option is enabled, UniCC produces about 20\-30% more
LALR(1) states. It can be useful for debugging purposes.
.SS -P, --production
.P
Dumps an overview about the finally produced productions and their
semantic actions.
.SS -s, --stats
.P
Prints a statistics message to stderr when parser generation has
entirely been finished. This will automatically switched on when
using the verbose option.
.SS -S, --states
.P
Dumps the generated LALR(1) states that had been generated during the
parse table generation process.
.SS -t, --stdout
.P
Print all code generator output to stdout instead as files.
.SS -T, --symbols
.P
Dumps an overview of all used symbols.
.SS -v, --verbose
.P
Prints process messages about the specific tasks during parser generation
process. Automatically switches on the stats option for statistics output.
.SS -V, --version
.P
Prints copyright and version information and exits.
.SS -w, --warnings
.P
Print relevant warnings.
.SS -x, --xml
.P
Triggers UniCC to run the parser description file generator additionally
to the program module generator. The parser description file generator
outputs an XML\-based parser representation of the generated parse tables,
which can be used by third\-party code generators or grammar analysis and
debugging tools.
.SS -X, --XML
.P
Triggers UniCC to only run the parser description file generator
without running the program\-module generator.
.P
Errors and warnings are printed to STDERR, any other kind of output to STDOUT.
