This template should serve as a general description and reference of how
templates for the UniCC parser generator's static build-in code generator
may be described.

It should be possible to abstract this template and given expansion macros
to several other programming languages, not only C-like ones.

In this template, there are many expansion macros used. Expansion macros begin
with "@@" and an following identifier. These macros are expaned in several
stages, some macros represend values that directly come from the code generator,
other macros define code-parts that had already been constructed by subsequent
construction stages and are inserted in particular positions. All macros are
pre-defined by the UniCC program module generator, is is not possible to build
own expansion macros or deviating construction logics due the statical structure
of the UniCC program module generator.

The expansion macro @@prefix holds the prefix which is possibly defined for a
grammar.

No XML-tag is 'really' required. UniCC will drop a warning when it misses a tag,
but continues code generation with the tags it finds.

Some of the following comments begin with 1D TABLE or 2D TABLE. A 1D TABLE
expands to a one-dimensional array, a 2D TABLE into a two-dimensional array;
To obtain the sizes for both dimensions, there are expanding macros both in the
<file>-tag and realted to every table.

1D Tables always consist of a <col> and a <col_sep> tag.
2D Tables always consist of a <row_start>, <row_end>, <row_sep>, <col> and a
<col_sep> tag. <row_sep> and <col_sep> define separators that will be inserted
between the rows/columns, except the last row/column.

The UniCC Standard C Parser Template provides the following features.

- Well tested, feature proven, used by UniCC's own grammar parser
- Platform and C-compiler independent, based on the C standard library only
- ANSI C89 and C99 compliant
- Thread-safe, parsers can recursively be called using an extendible
  Parser Control Block (pcb)
- Wide-character and UTF-8 Unicode input support
- Trace and stack trace facilities
- Build-in error recovery
- Build-in syntax tree generator
- Symbol and production tables for debug and syntax tree construction
- Provides a default parser test environment if no semantic code is given
- Dynamic end-of-file behavior

Please check the UniCC user manual for detailed information and notes on using
the UniCC Standard C Parser Template.

												string array produced by
												the <symbols>-tag.
					@@top-value				-	Expands to the variable
												pointing to the top of
												the value-stack.
					@@value-type-definition	-	Expands to the value type
												definitions.
					@@version_len			-	The length of the content of
												the #version parser
												directive.
					@@version				-	Content of the #version
												parser directive.

	The expansion macros @@basename, @@Cbasename, @@CBASENAME, @@filename,
	@@filename_len and @@prefix can be used everywhere in all tags. They are
	replaced as last. They can also be used in semantic actions defined in the
	parser's semantic actions. It is also possible to use the above macros in
	the filename-attribute of the file-tag, to generate adequate filenames.
